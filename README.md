## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

> Browser
> Text editor of your choice.
> npm has to be installed in your system.
> install linters on your IDE.

### Setup

> `git clone https://github.com/EraaniR/apple-clone.git`

### Usage

> Open the index.html from your browser.

### Run tests

Run `npx html-validator-cli --quiet --file index.html` to run the validator over the `index.html` file.

The `--quiet` will only list `errors`. If you also want to see the warnings use the `--verbose` flag instead.
As an alternative, you can also install the `html5validator` using `pip`:

```
pip install --user html5validator
html5validator index.html
```
